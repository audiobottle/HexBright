    v2.4  Dec 6, 2012
    https://github.com/hexbright/samples
    
    Cherry picked dazzle improvements from 
    https://github.com/digitalmisery/HexBrightFLEX:
    - Changed the way dazzle works and set flicker rate to match
    the known frequencies for vertigo (about 5 to 20Hz):
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_vertigo
    Cherry pick SOS from https://github.com/jaebird/samples.git
    * Added SOS to dazzle mode. To get there: press and hold pwr button to get dazzle, then 2 second long press again for SOS
